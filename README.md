# What is this?

This is the official repository for Content Booster.

## Requirements

You must have the following installed to run tests and executables:

1. [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/). It's OK if you don't have a GPU installed.
2. [Bazel](https://bazel.build/). This is our build system and helps organize models and our test infrastructure.

## Testing

To run the test suite, simply do:

*./run_tests.py*
